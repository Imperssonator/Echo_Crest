%> @brief Add n test samples from a given sample set to an existing test set
%> (may be empty). testSet is a vector of indices in the array samples
%> resembling the samples that are already in the set.
%> Type is one of 'random' or 'distance/uniform'.
%> invalidCandidates is an optional parameter which contains the indices
%> that resemble invalid candidates for adding in the list. These samples
%> are ignored as possible candidates for adding. Defaults to the empty
%> vector (all samples are allowed as candidates except for the ones
%> already in the test set).
