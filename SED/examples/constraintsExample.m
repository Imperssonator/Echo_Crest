% Note that in both cases, the corner points are not checked against the
% constraints because they are required for the algorithm to work.
% This might now be a problem, since the corner points can be removed later
% in post-processing and a good design will remain.

% This method does not need the corner points, and will thus guarantee that
% every point satisfies the constraints. We also execute this oncee twice,
% one with weights, and once without.

% Conclusion: mc-intersite-projected produces better results than
% mc-intersite-projected, but does select the corner points (which can
% later be removed manually, or by calling
% getAllPointsWithoutInitialDesign()). When using weights, points are
% distributed more evenly in rectangular spaces.
